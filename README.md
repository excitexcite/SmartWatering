# SmartWatering

SmartWatering is a small university project. The main project's purpose is to make the process of watering plants in university's classrooms more easy. 

Our development has moisture sensor that takes measurements once a time, that you could state manually (by editing the source code), and depending on the measurements it decides water the plant or not. Such approach makes the watering process almost automatic (you only need to fill you reservoir from time to time (periodicity depends on your plan and reservoir size)). 

There are three LED diod, that tell current moisture state: red means dry, yellow means semi-dry, green means wet. 

Some new features might be released soon.
